### ***Project is still a Work in Progess!!!!***
## What is Flexx TV?
Flexx TV or Flexx is if **Netflix, Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, Jackett, and uTorrent** all had a child that inharrited all their best traits and none of their bad...
I know thats a lot to promise, but I assure you that I can pull through.

## How Does it Work?
Flexx, not unlike Plex, has a server application running on the users computer where the user specifies a directory to host the media files.  Then it gathers all existing media files and creates a **REST** server which the various clients attach to.
### TL;DR
1. Launch Server App
2. Navigate to https://computers-local-ip-address:3208 and complete the setup process
3. Goto flexx-tv.tk and signin with same account from previous step
4. Add lots of Movies and TV
5. Invite Friends
6. ????
7. Profit?!?!
